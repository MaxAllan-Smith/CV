# Max Allan-Smith
I am a student of Makers Academy. Most of my working life has been in the automotive retail enviroment.
Over the past 4-5 years I have taken a real interest in coding and building software.
Because I have no IT or Computer Science qualifications and I wanted to get into the industry, I chose to do a course at Maker Academy to hopefully open the first door into the software development working world.
