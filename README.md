I am a student of Makers Academy. Most of my working life has been in the automotive retail enviroment.
Over the past 4-5 years I have taken a real interest in coding and building software.
Because I have no IT or Computer Science qualifications and I wanted to get into the industry, I chose to do a course at Maker Academy to hopefully open the first door into the software development working world.

## Work Experience

**Chastilian Motor Spares Ltd** (2013 - 2016)
_Sales Assistant_

 - My father owned the business and I was studying at North West Kent College (Music Performance).
I needed to genereate some form of income, so my father agreed to employ me as a Saturday worker. Over the course of about 6 months I became a part-time employee and began to learn more about the automotive retail sector. I was always good at computers and was able to maintain the server and do various updates to the system. We used a program called "T21" originally owned & built by and an american company, Activant.
The program handled everything from POS, Supplier Database, Product Database, Ledgers & Stock Control.
If something were to go wrong, I'd usually be the person to call to fix it.
I learnt a lot about servers and how programs worked throughout my time at Chastilians.
This is where I began to take a real interest in software and how things worked between application and database.
